# CSCI 200 Final Project: Pseudo Assembly Assembler
The Pseudo Assembly Assembler (PAA) is a simple assembler and simulator, meant
to introduce users to the concepts of low level programming and computer
architecture.
PAA is designed for a 16 bit reduced instruction set inspired by x86, with
some changes to make usage simple.
